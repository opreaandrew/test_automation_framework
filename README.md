Thought train so far:
- core: common utils, abstract_test_case, logging etc
- environment: config files
- targets: test runners
- tests: test cases
    Set up a sample test case. Going to model the framework after the test case, in order to keep it as simple as possible.
- models: page models
- slug.py: main entry point
